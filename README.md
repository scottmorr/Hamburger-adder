# Hamburger-adder
# Node Express Handlebars

### Overview

In this assignment, I created a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM. I followed  MVC design pattern; and used Node MySQL, and Handlebars to create the app.

In the image below, I created a responsive Hamburger_adder in MySQL database.  I connected the database with Node and Express.  All text you see was generated with Handlebars.  The user can manipulate hamburger positioning to Place on Menu to Devour with a simple click of a button.  







The below image indicates that the app user can alos Create a Burger, place it on the menu, and prepare to devour it!
